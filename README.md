## Tido vs Octavian set_similarity solutions

Two solutions enter, one graph leaves. Who will win out?

The two solutions for the toy problem are kept as intact as possible, with just the print statements
replaced with noops.

* Problem statement is in set_similarity.txt
* The two solutions are set_similarity_octavian.py and set_similarity_tido.py
* The benchmark framework is in bench_similarity.py
* Data from running benchmark on a crappy old box I have lying around is in runbench5.3.json
* Use CompareSolutions.ipynb to generate more pretty graphs.

Without further ado, the results in picture form:
